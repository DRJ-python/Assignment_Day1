    <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
        especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, 
        natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
        
        <h3>How does AI work?</h3>
       
        AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, 
        analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to 
        make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of 
        text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition 
        tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.
